  <h3>In The Lab</h3>
  <p>Jonah is a multifaceted scientist with a diverse experience in life science
		research. He's worked in 7 different labs over the course of 5 years,
		 each one bringing a unique perspective.
		 With each role he added another technique to his "scientific tool-belt" of
		 skills within a wet lab environment. At 18 he began working part time in
		 Dr. Jeremy Tzeng's laboratory as a lab assistant (2017). While the job was
		 small, autoclaving, dish-washing, & media formulations, it was all the
		 exposure he needed to understand he loved the environment. After spending a
		 year as a lab assistant for Dr. Tzeng he undertook an externship within the
		 Bioninformatics department of UNC Charlotte (2018). Under Dr. Cynthia Gibas
		 he participated in weekly discussions about The Urban Environmental Genome
		 Project. During this time graduate students under her supervision would
		 demonstrate basic techniques of metagenomcis. This was both his first
		 experience coding and with computational biology. In the following Fall
		 semester (2018) he stepped into Dr. Marc Birtwistle's lab within the
		 Chemical Engineering Dept. of Clemson University. From this initiating
		 role he's gained an irreplacible amount of knowledge. From creative inquiry
		 student researcher, lab assistant, research assistant, and even co-founder
		 of Blotting Innovations LLC (2021), these roles have provided a plethora of
		 experience.</p>

  <h3>Home Life</h3>
  <p>On the homefront Jonah has been blessed with a wonderful fiancee, a fierce one-eyed cat named Frank, and two gorgeous dogs; Trust & Luna. What started as a summer fling for two teenagers quickly became an inseperable bond and a wedding on October 23rd, 2021. Jonah grew up one of six boys in his grandparent's home in Indian Land, South Carolina. Amanda, originally from Long Beach, California, came to Fort Mill, South Carolina in 2008. Amanda and Jonah met in 2015 working as lifeguards at the local YMCA. They've enjoyed 6 years of emense happiness and look forward to even more in every moment to come!  </p>

  <h3>Impromptu-Techie</h3>
  <p>Jonah's dawn and twilight hours occupy themselves chasing eclectic tech
		 builds and programming projects. As a traditional life-science lab rat he'd
		 never thought that being a "techie" would be in the cards, but who chooses
		 what life has in store for them? Academic and Industry experience goes hand-
		 in-hand for Jonah, but when Jonah thinks of "fun" he either opts for exercise
		 or designing, building, losing control of, then conquering a weird machination.
	   Either functional or impractical, Jonah will surmount the project with at least
	   one positive note; life's a learning experience. <br />
	Jonah thoroughly enjoys taking on new programming languages, actively seeking out projects 
                 allowing him to do so. For instance, this website is his first exposure to all of 
                 front end development (that might be obvious). Whether its tinkering with a new 
                 raspberry pi based project, using FreeCAD 3D design as an excuse to write in python,
                 or adapting ASTM methods into an R pipeline for data interpretation, Jonah is just doing
                 it for fun</p>
