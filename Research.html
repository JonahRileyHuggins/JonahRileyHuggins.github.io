<h1>Research</h1><hr />
<p>Jonah's work has primarily been in the creation of an adapted western
	blotting technique, known as 'The Mesowestern Blot', capable of characterizing
	 upwards of 272 cellular lysates. Jonah joined the project in 2018 as an
	 undergraduate Creative Inquiry student and has spearheaded the design and
	 direction of the project since 2020. Here he developed a strong interest in
	 CAD design and prototyping and from this looks to integrate such experience
	 into future projects wherever applicable. Jonah designed and prototyped two
	 SDS-PAGE Casting & Electrophoresis systems for implementing mesowestern
	 blotting. Currently, the Mesowestern team been successful in creating methodology and
	 devices that boast higher quality protein data from 10 times more samples,
	 with 10 times less material required per sample and reduced labor compared
	 to conventional methods. The Mesowestern technique achieves this using 3D
	 parametric modeling, SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, and robotic pipetting,
	 excelling in simplicity.

<br />
Jonah is interested in biomolecular research & computational
biology contributing to multi-omic approaches for combating cancer. Jonah aims to
 create multifaceted projects that break out of academia, spinning real world
 applications, both domestic and abroad.</p>
