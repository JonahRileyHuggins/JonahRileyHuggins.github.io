<h1>Research</h1><hr />
<p>Jonah's work has primarily been in the creation of an adapted western blotting technique, known as 'The Mesowestern Blot', capable of characterizing upwards of 272 cellular lysates. Jonah joined the project in 2018, and has spearheaded the design and direction of the project since 2020. Jonah developed a strong interest in CAD design and prototyping, and from this looks to integrate such experience into future projects wherever applicable. Jonah designed and prototyped two SDS-PAGE Casting & Electrophoresis systems for implementing mesowestern blotting. Most recently The Birtwistle Lab Mesowestern team has began utilizing the technique for a high-lysate volume COVID-19 experiment. In tandem with ELISA testing, courtesy of the Dean Lab at Clemson University, the mesowestern assay is being tested as a qualitative confirmitory test. The test acts to reveal whether an individual's immune system, post-vaccination, is able to defend against the 5 notable SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Jonah is primarily interested in biomolecular research & computational biology that aids those in medically underdeveloped communities. Development and deployment of novel low cost biomolecular technologies are critical in fighting Diseases of Poverty and Neglected Tropical Diseases. Jonah aims to create multifaceted projects that break out of academia, spining real world applications, both domestic and abroad.</p>
