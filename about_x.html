   <h2>the Scientist</h2>
   <p>I am, first and foremost, a scientist by trade.  I've worked in 7 different labs over the course of 5 years, each one bringing a unique perspective. With each role I added another technique to my "scientific tool-belt" of skills within a wet lab environment. At 18 I began working part time in Dr. Jeremy Tzeng's laboratory as a lab assistant (2017). While the job was small, autoclaving, dish-washing, & media formulations, it was all the exposure I needed to understand I loved the environment. After spending a year as a lab assistant for Dr. Tzeng I undertook an externship within the Bioninformatics department of UNC Charlotte (2018). Under Dr. Cynthia Gibas I participated in weekly discussions about The Urban Environmental Genome Project. During this time graduate students under her supervision would demonstrate basic techniques of metagenomcis. This was both my first experience coding and with computational biology. In the following Fall semester (2018) I stepped into Dr. Marc Birtwistle's lab within the Chemical Engineering Dept. Of Clemson University. From this initiating role I've gained an irreplacible amount of knowledge. From creative inquiry student researcher, lab assistant, research assistant, and even co-founder of Blotting Innovations LLC (2021), this role has provided a plethora of experience.

   <h2>The Fiance</h2>
<p> On the homefront I've been blessed with a wonderful fiancee, a fierce one-eyed cat named Frank, and two gorgeous dogs; Trust & Luna. What started as a summer fling for two teenagers quickly became an inseperable bond and soon to be a lifetime of happiness. Jonah grew up one of six boys in his grandparent's home in Indian Land, South Carolina. Amanda, originally from Long Beach, California, and brought to Fort Mill, South Carolina in 2008. Amand and Jonah met in 2015 working as lifeguards at the local YMCA. We've enjoyed 6 years of emense happiness and look forward to even more in every moment to come!  </p>
